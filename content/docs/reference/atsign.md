An @sign is a handle (i.e. @alice) that functions as your digital identity. It uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that your data is 100% owned and controlled by you.

An @sign has two states: deactivated and activated. To activate an @sign, cram authenticate into your secondary server. After successful cram authentication, your @sign is activated where a PKAM key pair is generated by your device and the cram key will be invalid; so that only you own the keys to your secondary server.
