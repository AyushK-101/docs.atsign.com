## Definition
 PKAM stands for public key authentication mechanism. It is a mechanism for encrypting/decrypting data between two parties.

## @platform

The @platform's packages and SDKs help apps generate a RSA PKAM public/private keypair and save this in a `.atKeys` file containing these keys. Since Atsign provided the CRAM secret, this poses an invulnerability (because Atsign essentialy generated your password for you). To oppose this invulnerability, an RSA PKAM keypair is generated for subsequent authentications and the [CRAM](/docs/reference/cram) secret is voided. 

The PKAM public key is given out to other clients who want to send data to you. The data they send to you is encrypted using your public key and is decrypted using your private key. Read more on asymmetric encryption [here](/docs/reference/encryption).

The PKAM private key used by the client to authenticate into their own secondary server. It is just like the CRAM secret except it was generated by you (as opposed by Atsign) and completely owned by you. 

## @protocol

In the [@protocol](/docs/atplatform/specification) PKAM is a verb.

The pkam verb is used to authenticate one's own self as an owner of a Secondary Server using a PKI style authentication.

The following regex represents the syntax of the pkam verb: `^pkam:(?<signature>.+$)`
