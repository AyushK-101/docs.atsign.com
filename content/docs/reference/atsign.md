## What is an @sign
An @sign is a handle (i.e. @alice) that functions as your digital identity. It uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that your data is 100% owned and controlled by you.

An @sign has two states: deactivated and activated. To activate an @sign, [CRAM](/docs/reference/cram) authenticate into your [secondary server](/docs/reference/synchronization/). After successful CRAM authentication, your @sign is activated where a [PKAM](/docs/reference/pkam/) key pair is generated by your device and the CRAM key will be invalid; so that only you own the keys to your secondary server. 

## What you can do with an @sign
At the moment, you can pair your @sign with any app on the @platform (the underlying technology behind @signs) to enable the app to access, but not store, your data. The number of things you can do with your @sign will increase as more and more of these @apps are built.

While we wait for the rest of the Internet to catch up, you can get ahead of the game by downloading the first batch of recently launched @apps. These include @mospherePro, an end-to-end encrypted file sharing app, @buzz, an entirely new and private way to connect with others, and more.

Discover these @apps [here](https://atsign.com/apps/).
