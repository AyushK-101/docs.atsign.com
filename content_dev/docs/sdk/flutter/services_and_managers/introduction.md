This is where you can quickly learn and update yourself on various atPlatform concepts.

If you haven't already, we recommend you head to [Get Started Flutter Development](docs/start/flutter/) first.

The following is covered in this codelab:

- **AtClientManager** - an object with various services such as Client, NotificationService, and SyncService.
- **AtClientPreference** - object used to configure preferences in your atPlatform application such as the namespace, hiveStoragePath, or maxDataSize.
- **Onboarding** - process of activating an atSign and/or authenticating the atSign into its secondary server.
- **Key Basics** - learn how keys are stored in the secondary server and what key metadata is.
