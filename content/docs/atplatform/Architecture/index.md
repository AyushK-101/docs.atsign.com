If you're wondering what the difference between what the atPlatform consists of and what the atProtocol consists of, look no further!

The atPlatform, which has been created on top of the atProtocol consists of three major segments of developer tools. These segments consists of; [Services](/docs/functional_architecture/services/), [Libraries](/docs/functional_architecture/libraries/), and [Widgets](/docs/functional_architecture/widgets/)
