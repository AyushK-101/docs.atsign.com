### Definition
The ability within a coding language to have one variable, object, or function take on multiple forms within the same program, presenting the same interface for different underlying data types. Sometimes referred to as programming in the general, rather than in the specific. 

### Example
A class “Vehicle” with a function “Move”. Different subclasses of the class “Vehicle” such as “Car”, “Boat”, or “Plane” would have their own implementations of the same function “Move”, with the car driving, the boat sailing, and the plane flying.
