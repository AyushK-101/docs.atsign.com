### Definition
The condition of occuring in several different forms. 

Polymorphism on the @platform is the ability to share different data depending on the context of who’s asking. @platform applications enable you to setup multiple personas for different areas of your life. When you share data with someone else, the value of that data may be different depending on the person receiving that data.

### Example
@alice’s work persona may have a different value for email than her personal persona. When she shares her email to her colleagues, they will receive her work email, however when she shares it to her friends and family, they will see her personal email. As she updates the data in each of her personas, the changes will be reflected to each person that she has shared the data with.
