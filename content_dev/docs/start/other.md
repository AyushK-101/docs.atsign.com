## Open Source Contributions

We LOVE open source. Any and all contributions are welcome. 

The atPlatform consists of many open-sourced [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/atsign-foundation). To start, go into any repository and find the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to see how you can properly setup your fork to make contributions to our projects. [Here](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/atsign.dev-3.0/blob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md) is an example of the contributing guidelines for making contributions to the dev site that you are reading now. There may be different contributing guidelines for each repository, so be sure to read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` of the repository that you are contributing to.

Thank you for your contributions!
