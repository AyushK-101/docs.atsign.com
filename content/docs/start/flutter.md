## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1. Get an editor for programming in Dart

Some editors we recommend:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

### 2. Install Flutter/Dart on your machine

See Flutter's instructions on getting the Flutter environment setup:
- [MacOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos)
- [Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows)
- [Linux](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux)

### 3. Install at_app

[at_app](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_app) is a command-line tool for quickly creating atPlatform apps. It is similar to `flutter create` but adds atPlatform capabilities to your flutter apps. See our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ciusz9mPpVY) on at_app.

#### 4. Create an atPlatform app

Create an atPlatform app by using [at_app](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_app)
1. `at_app create <dir>`
2. `cd <dir>`
3. `flutter run`
