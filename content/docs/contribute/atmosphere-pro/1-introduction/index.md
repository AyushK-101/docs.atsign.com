In this tutorial, we will be cloning our project so that you can make contributions to our end-to-end encrypted file transfer app, atmosphere pro. To get started, you will need the following:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
3. A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for coding in Dart/Flutter.
4. The [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) framework
5. An environment to test and run the application ([Android](https://developer.android.com/studio), [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#macos-setup), or [Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows)).
